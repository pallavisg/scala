-For downloading dependencies of  tools which we are currently using i.e  scalastyle, scoverage, jacoco, gatling we require sbt 0.13.6/0.13.8.

- SCCT , on the other hand, gets downloaded with SBT 0.12.2 .

-I tried  downloading SCCT solely with SBT 0.12.2 and then tried itâ€™s execution with other tools using SBT 0.13.8 but even that did not work. 

-I tried to find a version of SBT which accomplishes resolving all dependencies including SCCT but in vain.
(tried versions are-
//sbt.version=0.13.8
//sbt.version=0.12.2
//sbt.version=0.13.6

//sbt.version=0.12.1
//sbt.version=0.12.3
//sbt.version=0.12.4


//sbt.version=0.13.5
//sbt.version=0.13.7
//sbt.version=0.13.9
) 

-When tried SCCT alone i.e removing all other tools' dependencies, I accomplished resolving its dependencies with version 0.12.2 but then this throws error when  I tried to "compile" it.

-When I tried it with the code-base in play, the dependencies for execution of the very code-base take 0.13.8 version so although SCCT dependencies got resolved with 0.12.2, it's of no use.

-Also as cited in the website http://mtkopone.github.io/scct/ , the latest updated information on SCCT is Dec 9 - 2012, no follow-ups after that.


Hence, the point I want to make after exploring SCCT is that scoverage has far better support than it(as of now).So , we have the aforesaid points to carry on with it.
